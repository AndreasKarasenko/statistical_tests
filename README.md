# Statistical tests
This Streamlit demo showcases some tests that can be done in the context of machine learning.
I mainly focus on comparing the performance of multiple models, or difference in performance between groups.

Special thanks to Dr. Benedikt Brand for giving me a valuable intro to statistical tests and providing the base for the picture.

To run this example install the dependencies and run 
~~~ bash
python -m streamlit run app\overview.py
~~~
from the project root.
